1 What's New?
*************

Welcome! This is the inaugural release of MP4v2.

This project's goal is to continue development of a C-library named
`libmp4v2' which was once a part of the (now defunct) MPEG4IP project.
That library, and some related command-line utilities were branched
from MPEG4IP version 1.6.1 to seed this project, MP4v2.

2 Breaking Changes
******************

2.1 Top-level header file
=========================

This release is nearly 100% API compatible with MPEG4IP, however there
are some differences. Dependents of this library must now include the
top-level public header file as follows. This is the only supported
mechanism to include the library. We do not support attempts to include
any sub-level header files; such files are private implementation
details and their naming must not be relied upon.

     #include <mp4v2/mp4v2.h>

2.2 Command-line utilities
==========================

The command-line utilities have been totally rewritten and enhanced.
Help usage has been made more consistent and enhanced, please invoke
the appropriate utility in this fashion for more details:

     command --help

Appendix A Changelog
********************

A.1 Version 1.9
===============

  1. Renamed public API top-level header to `<mp4v2/mp4v2.h>' and added
     namespaces for implementation (private) symbols. Only public API
     symbols are exported for dynamic (shared) or DLL libraries. All
     other symbols are now private, notwithstanding static-library
     usage.

  2. Added initial AC3 support.

  3. Added native Windows port. The port targets `WINVER 0x0500' which
     is Windows 2000 or higher.

  4. Added QuickTime and Nero chapter support. See `mp4chaps'
     command-line utility.
     Contributed by Ullrich Poll√§hne <u.pollaehne@gmail.com>.

  5. Enhanced `mp4art' to support multiple cover-art atoms.

  6. Dropped `mp4dump' and replaced with `mp4file' which supports
     general file operations.

  7. Added `mp4track' with colr-box and pasp-box support.

  8. Fixed corruption of udta.name atom during read-in.

  9. Enhanced `mp4file --dump' to show hexdump-style canonical
     hex+ASCII data.

 10. Enhanced `mp4file --dump' to show human-readble value for tag
     typeCode values.

 11. Enhanced `mp4file --dump' to show human-readble value for
     ISO-639-2/T language codes.

 12. Added new public-API: MP4GetTrackLanguage().

 13. Added new public-API: MP4SetTrackLanguage().

 14. Added support for GCC precompiled-headers on various *nix
     platforms to speed up builds as we are using quite a few C++
     headers.

 15. Enhanced `mp4track' to facilitate modification of { enabled,
     inmovie, inpreview, altgroup, volume, width, height, language,
     hdlrname, udtaname } properties.

 16. Added new public-API: MP4GetTrackDurationPerChunk().

 17. Added new public-API: MP4SetTrackDurationPerChunk() to override
     default per-track chunk duration.

 18. Added new public-API: MP4WriteSampleDependency().

 19. Replaced (undocumented) public-API: MP4CreateEx() with
     MP4CreateProvider().

 20. Added new public-API for iTMF Generic functionality.
